Within the scoped folder {scope_display}, perform a focused deep research pass
for the following section from the agent-doc plan:

<<<SECTION_TITLE>>>
{section_title}
<<<END_SECTION_TITLE>>>

<<<SECTION_BODY>>>
{section_body}
<<<END_SECTION_BODY>>>

Explain which concrete code, tests, and configs implement this aspect, describe
their responsibilities and interactions, and include inline [N] citations that
refer to the Sources table in the final agent doc.

Do NOT output a top-level '# Agent Doc' heading or a '## Sources' footer.
