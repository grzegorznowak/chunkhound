"""Copy the downloaded DuckDB runtime library next to the compiled
chunkhound_native extension, for local maturin build + install_native.py
setups.

Wheel-repair tools (auditwheel/delocate/delvewheel) bundle the runtime into
release wheels, but local maturin-build wheels don't reliably carry it (see
_select_files in scripts/install_native.py for what gets extracted). This
script closes that gap for the local dev loop, on every platform, so the
self-relative $ORIGIN/@loader_path RPATH baked in at link time has something
to find.
