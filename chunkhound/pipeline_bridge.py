    Uses a provider AND an event loop cached per OS thread (keyed by

    run: a thread id is only stable *within* one run (Rust rebuilds its
    embed thread pool from scratch on every run, so ids can otherwise be
    recycled and collide with a stale entry left by an earlier, unrelated
    run). ``cache`` itself is scoped to one ``run_rust_pipeline()`` call
    (see ``_EmbedThreadCache``), so ``run_rust_pipeline()`` drains and
    explicitly shuts down *its own* cache in its ``finally``
    (``_shutdown_embed_thread_resources``) once that run's pipeline.run()
    call returns, rather than leaving
    entries to be silently reused or dropped for GC -- a provider holds a
    live HTTP client and the loop is a real OS-level event loop, both of
    which need an explicit close to avoid leaking a socket/fd every run.

    NOTE: this used to use ``threading.local()``, which turned out not to
    persist across separate ``Python::with_gil()`` calls from the same
    Rust-native rayon thread — each call got a fresh ``threading.local()``
    namespace (visible as CPython auto-naming the attaching thread
    "Dummy-N" every time), silently defeating the cache and creating a new
    provider + event loop on *every single batch* instead of once per
    thread. Keying an explicit module-level dict by the raw OS thread id
    (which — unlike the ``threading.local()`` namespace — really is stable
    across calls) fixes this; see git history for the diagnostic that
    confirmed only ``embed_thread_pool_size`` distinct thread ids exist but
    hundreds of provider/loop instances were being created.

    The Rust embed thread's rayon pool is built once per pipeline run and
    reused across every streamed batch, so its worker OS threads are
    long-lived — the same thread makes many calls to this function over the
    life of a run. httpx's AsyncClient binds internal locks/transports to
    whichever event loop is running when it's first used; calling
    ``asyncio.run()`` here would create and tear down a *new* loop on every
    call while still reusing the same cached client, and running that
    client under a succession of different loops hangs (the client's locks
    stay attached to the loop they were created under, which is already
    closed). Reusing one loop per thread via ``run_until_complete`` keeps
    the client bound to a single, stable loop for as long as the thread
    lives.
